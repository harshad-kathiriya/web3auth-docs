## Introduction

---

Adding Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs to your application is a great way to authenticate users and reconstruct their private key, and to reconstruct the
key, Web3Auth SDK redirects users to a Web3Auth hosted screen (i.e. http://app.openlogin.com). This flow is great for most use cases. Still, sometimes
you may want to customize the authentication flow such that you can have more control over the UI and UX of the authentication process (i.e. to avoid
the redirection to openlogin hosted screens). This guide will show you how to use one such flow to authenticate users without redirecting to a
Web3Auth-hosted screen.

So before we get started, let's look at the general authentication flow in web3auth.

When a user logs in with Web3Auth, a user's account can be in two states:

- **Account Without MFA**: When the User logs in with only social login and key is secured by web3auth network.
- **Account With MFA**: When the User enables MFA by adding other shares like password, backup share, device share, etc., to the existing account.

By default, to reconstruct the key in both states, web3auth SDK redirects the user to http://app.openlogin.com. Where all the computation to
reconstruct the key is done. The advantage of this approach is that it makes it easy for applications to integrate web3auth SDK without having to
worry about the key reconstruction process. But sometimes, applications want to reconstruct the key in their application context, where the
authentication flow described in this guide comes in.

Currently, there are two ways to achieve this:

- **First** is using the self-hosted approach where the application itself handles both states of the user's accounts.
- **Second** approach is a hybrid approach where the application handles the user's account state without MFA, and the account state with MFA is
  handled by web3auth SDK by redirecting to openlogin.

_**In this guide, we will be looking at the second approach**_. If you are curious about the first approach, you can look at our self-hosted docs
[here](/self-hosting).

:::info note

We will refer this approach as `One Key Flow` in the upcoming sections.

## Quick Start

---

If you want to check what the result of this guide will look like, you can clone the example project from our GitHub repo and run it as described
below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Web3Auth/examples.git
cd examples/node-sdk/one-key-flow/react-one-key-evm-example
npm install
npm run start
```

## How it works?

---

![Web3Auth Core - One Key Flow](/images/one-key-flow.png)

Refer to the flow chart above to understand how the `One Key Flow` works:

- The first step for the application is to get the user authenticated by social login and get the user's idToken.
- Once the social login is successful, depending on if the user has enabled **Multi Factor Authentication(MFA)** or not, the key is generated.
- If the user has not enabled MFA, we use the `@web3auth/node-sdk` library to retrieve the private key shares from the Web3Auth auth network nodes and
  reconstruct the private key.
- If the user has enabled MFA, the private key can be reconstructed simply via Web3Auth Login using Web3Auth SDK by redirecting the user to
  `app.openlogin.com`.

Also, it is up to the application whether they want to give the option to enable MFA in the application. If you don't want to provide the option to
enable MFA in your application. You can skip the parts of this guide where we explain enabling MFA in the application. But the good part is that this
is _**future compatible**_. If you want to enable MFA in your application in the future, you can do it easily by adding a few lines of code.

## Prerequisites

---

- You should know how Web3Auth works. You can read about it [here](/overview/how-web3auth-works).
- You should know how to create a basic application on Web3Auth by following this [quck-start](https://web3auth.io/docs/quick-start).
- We will be using react.js in this app, so basic knowledge of react is expected to follow the guide.
- A [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com) account to be used as Federated Identity Provider.
- A [Google Developer](https://console.developers.google.com) account to be used as Identity provider for Firebase.

## Setup

---

### Setup your JWT provider

- One key flow will work with any JWT provider. For this particular guide we will use Firebase as our JWT provider.
- You can follow the [Firebase guide](/guides/firebase#setup-your-firebase-project) to setup Firebase.

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

<SetupWeb3AuthDashboard />

Below are the steps to setup Firebase as JWT Provider. The same steps can be followed for any other JWT provider.

- Create a **Verifier** from the **Custom Auth** Section of the [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) with following
  configuration:

  - Choose a name of your choice for the verifier identifier. `eg. w3a-firebase-verifier`
  - Select environment: `testnet`, `mainnet` or `cyan` as per your requirement.
  - Select `Custom` from the **Login Provider**.
  - Select `Sub` for the **JWT Verifier ID**.
  - Enter `https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com` as the JWK endpoint for Firebase's idToken.
  - JWT validation fields:
    - iss: `https://securetoken.google.com/<firebase-project-id>`.
    - aud: `<firebase-project-id>`
  - Click on `Create` button to create your verifier. It may take up to 10 minutes to deploy verifier on _testnet_. You'll receive an email once it's
    complete.

  ![Custom Authentication - Create Firebase Verifier](/contents/guides/firebase/firebase-custom-verifier.png)

- You will require the `verifierName` of the newly created verifier and `clientId` of the Plug and Play Project.

### Setting up react project.

- You can simply setup react project using `create-react-app`.

  If you are using `create-react-app` version >= 5 you may run into issues building. Those issues can be resolved by following the troubleshooting
  guide given [here](/troubleshooting/webpack-issues)

## Implementing User Login.

---

Doing user login with one key flow consists of following steps:

- Authenticate user with social login provider.
- Checking if user's mfa is enabled.
- If mfa is not enabled, then login with `@web3auth/node-sdk` sdk.
- If mfa is enabled, then login with `@web3auth/core` sdk.

### Authenticate user with social login provider.

In this guide, we are using firebase to authenticate the user's Identity and get the idToken. You can use any other social login provider as well.

Following is the code snippet to authenticate a user with firebase and get the `idToken`.

```js
// Import the functions you need from the SDK
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyDEfyUmXDhgGWibRUro2EBoX8-TtBKMYyA",
  authDomain: "web3auth-x-firebase-demo-e3332.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "web3auth-x-firebase-demo-e3332",
  storageBucket: "web3auth-x-firebase-demo-e3332.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "108145034076",
  appId: "1:108145034076:web:3ff4c0088ec4c311b17799",
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
import { GoogleAuthProvider, getAuth, signInWithPopup, UserCredential, User } from "firebase/auth";

const signInWithGoogle = async (): Promise<UserCredential> => {
  try {
    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
    const auth = getAuth(app);
    const googleProvider = new GoogleAuthProvider();
    const res = await signInWithPopup(auth, googleProvider);
    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    throw err;
  }
};

// Calling the signInWithGoogle function to get the idToken

const loginRes = await signInWithGoogle();
const idToken = await loginRes.user.getIdToken(true); // this idToken will be passed to web3auth
```

### Checking if user's MFA is enabled and implementing login.

Now we have `idToken` and login response from firebase, which will give the user's detail. We will use these two fields to check whether a user has
already enabled MFA or not.

The check can be made by calling the `connect` method of `@web3auth/node-sdk`. This method will throw an error if the user has already enabled MFA.
Note that this function takes idToken as a parameter which is the `idToken` we got from Firebase.

:::info

Ensure that the `idToken` passed to the `connect()` is a newly issued Token(JWT).

:::

```js
import { Web3Auth } from "@web3auth/node-sdk";

const verifier = "YOUR_VERIFIER_NAME"; // verifier that you created earlier from web3auth dashboard.
const verifierId = loginRes.user.uid; // user's id from firebase login response or this can be any unique user's id like email etc.
const idToken = "YOUR_ID_TOKEN"; // idToken from firebase login response or from your own backend.

const web3auth = new Web3Auth({
  clientId, // Get your Client ID from Web3Auth Dashboard
  chainConfig: {
    chainNamespace: "eip155",
    chainId: "0x1",
    rpcTarget: "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth", // needed for non-other chains
  },
});

await web3auth.init({
  network: "testnet",
});

const web3AuthProvider = await web3auth?.connect({
  verifier,
  verifierId: sub,
  idToken,
});
```

At this point, your application has successfully authenticated the user with web3auth, and you can use the `web3AuthProvider` to interact with the
blockchain.

:::caution

Note if you will use the above code snippet. The `connect()` method will throw an error if the user has already enabled MFA. If MFA is enabled, use
the flow described in the next section.

:::

Now, if you want to know how to login with MFA or upgrade your user's account to MFA, you can refer to the next section. Otherwise, you can skip to
the section [here](/guides/one-key-flow#interacting-with-blockchain) to learn how to use blockchain providers.

### Implementing login with MFA.

If the user's MFA is enabled, we can simply login with `@web3auth/core` SDK.

Here are the steps required to login with MFA:

#### Instantiate Web3Auth sdk

```js
import { Web3AuthCore } from "@web3auth/core";
import { CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

const chainConfig = {
  chainNamespace: CHAIN_NAMESPACES.EIP155, // SOLANA, OTHER
  chainId: "0x3",
  rpcTarget: "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_ropsten",
  displayName: "Ropsten Testnet",
  blockExplorer: "https://ropsten.etherscan.io/",
  ticker: "ETH",
  tickerName: "Ethereum",
};
const web3auth = new Web3AuthCore({
  chainConfig,
});
```

#### Initialising the Openlogin Adapter

```js
const verifier = "YOUR_VERIFIER_NAME"; // verifier that you created earlier from web3auth dashboard.
const openloginAdapter = new OpenloginAdapter({
  loginSettings: {
    mfaLevel: "mandatory",
  },
  adapterSettings: {
    network: "testnet",
    uxMode: "redirect",
    loginConfig: {
      jwt: {
        name: "Web3Auth One Key Login Flow",
        verifier,
        typeOfLogin: "jwt",
        clientId,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

You must pass your Web3Auth `clientId` in the adapterSettings object and your Custom Auth `verifierName` in the loginConfig object. To learn more
about openloginAdapterParams refer to docs [here](/sdk/web/openlogin#web3authopenlogin-adapter).

#### Initialising the Web3Auth SDK

```js
await web3auth.init();
```

#### Login with MFA

```js
const idToken = "YOUR_ID_TOKEN"; // idToken from firebase login response or from your own backend.
// if NO, login with web3auth
const web3AuthProvider = await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    id_token: idToken,
    verifierIdField: "sub",
    domain: window.location.origin,
  },
});
```

When connecting using Web3Auth SDK, the `connectTo` function takes the arguments for the adapter you want to connect to and the options for the login.
A few important things to note here is the `idToken` and `verifierIdField` option in the `extraLoginOptions` object. The idToken is received from
Firebase SDK, and `verifierIdField` is the field's name in idToken, which contains the value of the user's id. This field is also defined while
creating a verifier in web3auth's dashboard.

Once the `connectTo` function resolves, it will return a blockchain provider the same as the one we got in login without MFA. We will use this
blockchain provider to fetch the user's balance from the blockchain.

Refer to [this file](https://github.com/Web3Auth/examples/blob/main/web-core-sdk/one-key-flow/src/loginWithMfa.ts) for login without MFA flow.

:::info NOTE

Once enabled by the User, MFA cannot be disabled.

## How to enable Multi Factor Authentication(MFA) for your users

---

So far, we have seen how to login with MFA and without MFA. But there might be a case in your application where you want the user to start without MFA
for easy onboarding. Later, you want your users to enable MFA to enhance security.

The process to enable MFA is quite simple, as described in the code snippet below. Still, the caveat is once the user enables MFA, the user won't be
able to disable it. So make sure your login screen is flexible enough to cater both with and without MFA flows if you are giving this option in your
application.

The following code snippet depicts how to enable MFA for users while using Firebase as the JWT provider.

```js
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS } from "@web3auth/base";
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
const firebaseConfig = {
  //...Your firebase config
};
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

// initialize web3auth sdk here as described in login with mfa step

// ...
// ...
// ...

const enableMfa = async () => {
  const auth = getAuth(app);
  const user = auth.currentUser;
  // user
  const idToken = await user.getIdToken(true);

  // web3auth instance must be initialized before calling this function
  // as decribed in login with mfa flow above
  const web3AuthProvider = await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
    loginProvider: "jwt",
    extraLoginOptions: {
      id_token: idToken,
      verifierIdField: "sub",
      domain: window.location.origin,
    },
    mfaLevel: "optional",
  });
  return web3AuthProvider;
};
```

:::info NOTE

Once enabled by the User, MFA cannot be disabled.

:::

## Get the User Profile

---

Depending upon if the user has enabled MFA or not, we can get the user profile from the provider.

<Tabs
defaultValue="mfa"
values={[
  { label: "MFA Enabled", value: "mfa" },
  { label:"MFA Disabled", value:"mfa-disabled" },
]}
>

<TabItem value="mfa">

```js
const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo();
console.log("User info", user);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mfa-disabled">

```js
const user = parse(idToken);
console.log("User info", user);
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Depending if the user has enabled MFA or not the functions to get the user profile will be different. If the user has enabled MFA, you can use the
`getUserInfo` function to get the user profile.

## Logout

---

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `logout` function.

<Tabs
defaultValue="mfa"
values={[
  { label: "MFA Enabled", value: "mfa" },
  { label:"MFA Disabled", value:"mfa-disabled" },
]}
>

<TabItem value="mfa">

```js
await web3auth.logout();
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mfa-disabled">

Set the provider to null. This will log out the user.

```js
setProvider(null);
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>
