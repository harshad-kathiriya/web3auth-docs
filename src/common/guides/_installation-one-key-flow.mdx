You will need to install dependencies given below to get started with the project. Description about each dependency is given below. If you only want
to add login without mfa flow to your application you can skip installation of dependencies required for login with mfa.

#### Dependencies Required for login without mfa:-

##### `@toruslabs/torus.js`

This is the JS utility library for Torus that we can use to make calls to the Torus Network. This library handles these checks and allows you to query
the Torus network easily through these APIs:

- retrieveShares
- getUserTypeAndAddress

```shell
npm install --save @toruslabs/torus.js
```

##### `@toruslabs/openlogin-subkey`

This is a helper library that helps with the generation of app-scoped keys. Subkey package is required to make sure user will get same key even after
enabling MFA.

```shell
npm install --save @toruslabs/openlogin-subkey
```

##### `@toruslabs/fetch-node-details`

This package is used to fetch details of the Torus node that we will be using for authentication.

```shell
npm install --save @toruslabs/fetch-node-details
```

#### Dependencies Required only login with mfa:-

##### `@web3auth/core`

This is the main **Core** package that contains the Web3Auth SDK.

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/core
```

##### `@web3auth/openlogin-adapter`

For using Custom Authentication, we need to use the **OpenLogin Adapter**, where we can initialise the authentication details.

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/openlogin-adapter
```

##### `@web3auth/base`

Since we're using typescript, we need the **`@web3auth/base`** package to provide types of the different variables we'll be using throughout the app
building process. This reduces errors to a very large extent.

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/base
```

#### Web3 Libraries to interact with the blockchain

##### `web3`

According to your preference, you can choose to install the `web3` or `ethers` libraries, to talk to the EVM compatible blockchains under the hood.
For Solana, `@solana/web3.js` is the recommended choice.

We'll be using `web3` for this guide.

```shell
npm install --save web3
```
