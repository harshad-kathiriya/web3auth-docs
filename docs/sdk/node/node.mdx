## [`@web3auth/node-sdk`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/node-sdk)

Web3Auth's `@web3auth/node-sdk` SDK is a simple and easy to use SDK in your Node.js backend to get the same experience of Web3Auth frontend SDKs.

## Installation

---

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/node-sdk
```

### Consider adding `@web3auth/base` to your project

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/base
```

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by providing you a standard way of importing the values you
need to work with the SDKs. We highly recommend using it while working with `Typescript`.
